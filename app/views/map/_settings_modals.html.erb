      This value is the opacity of the route on the map. The value is in percent, and it can be set from 0 to 100. The default value is 100, which means that the route is fully visible. If you set the value to 0, the route will be invisible.

      Points on the map are connected by lines. This value is the maximum distance between two points to be connected by a line. If the distance between two points is greater than this value, they will not be connected, and the line will not be drawn.

      This value is the threshold, based on which a visit is calculated. If the time between two consequent points is greater than this value, the visit is considered a new visit. If the time between two points is less than this value, the visit is considered as a continuation of the previous visit.

      For example, if you set this value to 30 minutes, and you have four points with a time difference of 20 minutes between them, they will be considered as one visit. If the time difference between two first points is 20 minutes, and between third and fourth point is 40 minutes, the visit will be split into two visits.
